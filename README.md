##Developpers 

We os is designed to let you quickly create your apps, or import existing ones.

You may use standard javascript + html5 
or ES2015 
The main idea was to recycle existing js projects (we can find thousands on github for example) and give them a chance to be installed and used easily on a wide free app store.
